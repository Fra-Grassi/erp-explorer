# ERP Explorer

A Shiny app to visualize and explore ERP waveforms

The idea is to be able to explore data by averaging across channels or subjects, by selecting individual channels or experimental conditions, etc...

Work in progress, still in early stages. 

Here a temporary list of the functions I implemented so far:

- Visualize waveforms divided by experimental condition, averaging across channels, subjects or both
